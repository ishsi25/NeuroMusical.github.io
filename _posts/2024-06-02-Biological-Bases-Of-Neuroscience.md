# Introduction and Overview: 
Neuroscience explores how the brain and nervous system influence our thoughts, emotions, and actions. Examining the biological aspects of our thoughts and behavior helps us understand how neural processes work.

## Brain Structure:
- **Cerebrum**
  - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain.
  - Divided into left and right hemispheres.
  - Contains the cerebral cortex, which is involved in complex processes like perception, reasoning, and memory.

- **Cerebellum**
  - Located at the back of the brain.
  - Coordinates voluntary movements like balance, coordination, and speech.

- **Brainstem**
  - Connects the brain to the spinal cord.
  - The main functions are controlling heart rate, breathing, and sleep cycles.
  - Composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.

- **Thalamus**
  - Located near the center of the brain.
  - Acts as a relay station for sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex.

- **Hypothalamus**
  - Located below the thalamus.
  - Regulates body temperature, hunger, thirst, and circadian rhythms.
  - Controls the endocrine system through the pituitary gland.

- **Limbic System**
  - A group of interconnected structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate gyrus.
  - Involved in emotion, memory, and motivation.
    
- **Corpus Callosum**
  - A large bundle of nerve fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.
  - Helps with communication between the left and right hemispheres.
 
## **Neurons**:
  - Neurons are the basic structure of communication. 
  - Neurons communicate through action potentials.
  - Action potentials are a series of electrical impulses that travel down the axon and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse.
  - Glial cells provide support and insulation for neurons.
    
## **Neurotransmitters**:
  - Neurotransmitter imbalances are implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
  - They can be inhibitory and exciatory.
  - Example of some neurotransmitters include dopamine and norepinephrine. 
  - Psychotropic medications target neurotransmitter systems to alleviate symptoms of mental illness.
